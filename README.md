## Overview

### The project

The challenge is to build out a advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- postcss autoprefixer and cssnano
- scss with 7 to 1 file structure
- fontsource

### What I learned

This was my first time using an API so i mainly learned how to use the fetch API and the advice generator API.
I also improved on my file structure and can now see the advantage of the 7 to 1 structure with scss.

### Continued development

I can still organize my files better and create a good pipeline to transform mu files instead of running every npm script on its own. And i should comment my code better and commit more often. I know that this is a small project but i want to get into the habit of being organized for when i tackle a big project.
